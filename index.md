## Highlight projects

`2024-now`
LUMI.,JSC, Design and develop **A Decentralized Smart Home Protocol**, all services are built with Rust, Protobuf. This protocol enables direct device-to-device communication over local networks and internet relay, simplifying IoT device development and integration with third-party services and AI assistants.

LUMI.,JSC, Designed and developed **A Decentralized IoT Relay Network** as a high-performance alternative to centralized MQTT using Rust, QUIC, and TCP/TLS. Built on [**atm0s-sdn**](https://github.com/8xff/atm0s-sdn), this solution achieves 10x lower latency while reducing infrastructure and maintenance costs. The network seamlessly handles device communications across both local and public networks without configuration changes, enabling efficient management of millions of LUMI's devices.

`2023-now`

8xFF Foundation, Developed **an open-source decentralized network and media server platform** that scales globally for real-time streaming applications. Built entirely in Rust, this platform serves as a high-performance, cost-effective alternative to commercial solutions like Cloudflare Calls and Agora, offering enterprise-grade media streaming capabilities in a decentralized architecture. In particular, the routing algorithm can reduce cross-zone latency by up to 100ms (40%).

`2021-2023`
Bluesea Network Co.,Ltd, Research and develop **a decentralized network for global scale realtime multimedia communications**. Create new routing algorithm which solves latency and scale problems in decentralized networks, especially in realtime multimedia communications. Submit patent for the new routing algorithm. All services are built with Rust.

`2020`
OWS Vietnam, Jsc, Designed and developed **A CCTV cloud platform**. Optimized for low-latency and low-spec edge devices with lightweight C++ WebRTC library. Support both live view and recording. This service was used in all Lumi-Home CCTV devices across Vietnam. The core device is written in C++ and the cloud platform is written in Golang.

OWS Vietnam, Jsc, Designed and developed **a modular VoIP system with SIP and WebRTC** with NodeJS and Freeswitch.

`2018`
OWS Vietnam, Jsc, Design and develop **a video conference system for e-learning**, resolving the challenge of recording all sessions with minimum overhead, and avoiding the need for media encode or decode. All services are built with C++ and NodeJS.

OWS Vietnam, Jsc, Develop **a scalable and low latency WebRTC SFU media-server** with C++ and NodeJS.

OWS Vietnam, Jsc, Create **a lightweight C++ WebRTC library** for servers and embedded systems.

`2015`
OWS Vietnam, Jsc, Design and develop **a backend for an online interview service** with both chat and WebRTC video streaming.

`2014`
Topica Edtech Group, **Customize and scale BigBlueButton**, an open-source video conference system, to serve 1000 concurrent users.
